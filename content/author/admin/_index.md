Hi, I'm Victor. I'm a 3rd year SM/PhD student working with [Daniel Sanchez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/)
at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).
My primary work is in [the Swarm project](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/pervasive-parallelism-swarm-architecture),
which seeks to build new abstractions between hardware and software
that make it as easy to exploit multicore parallelism
as it is to write ordinary sequential programs.
My work spans microarchitectures, compilers, and applications.
I seek to redefine the roles of hardware and software,
not only to make it easy to scale workloads where parallelization
is expensive and error-prone today,
but also to make it practical to scale workloads that
today's systems cannot scale at all.

Before coming to MIT, I received my BSE in electrical engineering
from [Princeton](https://engineering.princeton.edu/),
where I worked with [Sharad Malik](http://www.princeton.edu/~sharad/)
on [Boolean satisfiability solvers](/talks/fields_2016_sat_efficiency.pdf).
I have also done internships working on the design of
hardware systems at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/),
[Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/),
and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/tunable-supercontinuum-fiber-laser-source-brdf-measurements-starr-ii-gonioreflectometer).

You can access my _curriculum vitae_ [here](/cv.pdf).
