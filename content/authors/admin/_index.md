Hi, I'm Victor.
I build computer architecture simulators and compilers
to explore how to make computation fast.
I write a lot of C++, and frequently look at profiling and (dis)assembly.
I'm starting a job at [Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/) in July 2023.

I'm currently finishing my PhD working with [Daniel Sanchez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/)
at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).
My PhD work is in [the Swarm project](http://swarm.csail.mit.edu),
which seeks to build new abstractions between hardware and software
that make it as easy to exploit multicore parallelism
as it is to write ordinary sequential programs.

Before I was at MIT, I received my BSE in electrical engineering
from [Princeton](https://engineering.princeton.edu/),
where I worked with [Sharad Malik](http://www.princeton.edu/~sharad/)
on [Boolean satisfiability solvers](/talks/fields_2016_sat_efficiency.pdf).
I have also done internships working on
optimizing the performance of hardware and software systems
at [MSR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/),
[NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/),
[Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/),
and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/tunable-supercontinuum-fiber-laser-source-brdf-measurements-starr-ii-gonioreflectometer).

You can access my _curriculum vitae_ [here](/victorying_cv.pdf).
